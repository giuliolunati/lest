plugins
Each plugin as two parts: STARTUP and MAIN (plus CLEANUP later).
Both are optional.
STARTUP is code added to header.
MAIN is main pligin rule. It can use subrules defined in plugin.

Example:

startup: [
	stylesheet %my.css
]

main: [
	my-rylue1
|	my-rue2	
]

my-rule1: [
	'kickass
	(emit "kikas")
]

my-rule2: [
	'kmotr
	(emit "csdsa")
]

Direct emiting is strongly discouraged. There are predefined rules tha shoud be used instead.

(set tag-name: 'some-tag)
init-tag
emit-tag
end-tag

This is basic mode of operation. This can be extended for recursive matching

(set tag-name: 'some-tag)
init-tag
emit-tag
match-content
end-tag




*** MATH

Lest numbers can be both of number! or string! type. This means that you can write number in three ways:
1, "1" and {1}, they are the same number.This approach makes it much easier to deal with CGI input and some
plugins, such as Redis, that return numbers as string!.  Currently, only integer numbers can be used. Float numbers
will be added later.

+++ math operators

Currently, +, - and * infix operators are implemented. More will be added later. Math operators require number 
or variable as argument on both sides. Commands as arguments are not supported.


	1 + 1								== "2"
	1 + "1"							== "2"
	set x 1 1 + x						== "2"
	set x join [1 0] x + 1			== "11"

	but - 

	1 + join [1 0]						== error!
